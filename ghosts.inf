I don't know how to explain, but I'm sure you've noticed that Blackwood is an unusual place, where long forgotten secrets lurk in the shadows.

In fact, a lot has happened in the last few hours that has fundamentally turned your world view upside down.^^Rosie: It's not the first time someone in Blackwood has been through what you're going through. Most of the time it didn't end well. There is a story of a groom who worked here over two hundred years ago. He said the forest called his name. One night he went home and killed his wife and his daughters with an axe. With their blood he wrote on the wall: ~He is here!~ before hanging himself from a weeping willow in the garden. And don't forget Lord Bain, who was so mad he thought an angel was speaking to him. At his behest, he slaughtered an entire village not far from here.

Blackwood was built on the remains of an ancient monastery, where the great hall was a multifunctional room, used to receive guests but it was also a place where the monks would dine together. Later, the Lord of Blackwood, his gentleman attendants and at least some of the servants would follow this tradition. At night, some members of the household would sleep on the floor to warm themselves by the fire. Today, the Great Hall is used as a sitting room with a cosy Victorian interior.";
          TheChapel: "While you read the compendium, your footsteps echo softly off the cold, rough stone walls, breaking the almost palable silence that adds to the sense of reverence pervading this sacred place. The large wooden crucifix, its once gilded surface now dulled with age, is said to be a remnant from Blackwood's earliest days. Rumour has it that a saint is buried here somewhere. But knowledge of the body's whereabouts has been lost. Perhaps it is just a story that has been told down through the generations until it has become a legend.";
          Oratory: "The oratory was used by the Lord and his family for private prayer and contemplation. The wooden cross and the single pew in front of it are said to be elaborately crafted masterpieces, clearly of higher quality than in the chapel.";
          Vestibule: "The vestibule is described as a place that causes a sense of awe, and you agree. Especially the high ceiling, supported by grand columns and arches, and the walls, decorated with intricate carvings and tapestries, are particularly mentioned.";
          Sacristy: "The compendium unfortunately does not say much about the sacristy. The only interesting bit of information is that a chalice and a paten from the 15th century are kept here, a gift from King James IV of Scotland. They are made of pure gold. You can probably find them in the chest with iron fittings in front of you.";
          Kitchen: "The kitchen has been modernised in the 1970s by a local architect from Inverness, with the goal to retain its old world charm and historic character that reflects its storied past. And indeed, as you look around you are immediately transported back to a bygone era. It is easy to imagine the hustle and bustle of the staff as they worked to create the elaborate dishes that would have been served to the lords and ladies of the manor. The compendium explicitly mentions the sturdy oak cupboards, shelves and drawers, which date back to the 16th century.";
          Pantry: "The purpose of the pantry in medieval times was to store food supplies and ensure that the manor had enough provisions to get through the winter months. Pantries are usually located on the east side of a manor house, where they are least exposed to the sun. Blackwood's modernised pantry is described as a juxtaposition of modern appliances and antique stone.";
          Buttery: "The buttery was intended for storing and dispensing beverages, especially ale and whisky. One needs to consider that in the early middle ages, water was not safe to drink so an assortment of alcoholic beverages was essential for the manor life. The person who presided over the buttery was called the butler, which explains where the name has its origins. One of the finest collections of whisky in Scotland can be found in Blackwood's buttery. Quite a few sealed bottles here are up to 200 years old and are considered extraordinarily valuable, some even from distilleries closed long ago. There's a sense of history and tradition in the air that's as intoxicating as the booze itself.";
          Storeroom: "The compendium does not mention the storeroom, which is not much of a surprise. There are places way more exciting to be talked about in the manor.";
          Library: "One can only be impressed by the grandeur of Blackwood's library. It hosts a massive collection of books, many of them very old and certainly invaluable with some of the editions even dating back to the time when Blackwood Manor was a monastery. These handwritten and richly decorated early historical works were curated by monks and scholars in darkened chambers as they preserved their knowledge for posterity with a quill by candlelight. One wonders what secrets they may hold.";
          Forecourt: "The forecourt has much to discover, visitors should take their time to explore every single detail of this time-honoured location. Especially the large stone fountain, decorated with carvings of Celtic knots and ancient Gaelic symbols, surrounded by sculptures representing mythical creatures from Scottish folklore is praised for its beauty. Which of the creatures do you recognise? Above the entrance a coat of arms bearing the image of a stag can be seen, a symbol of Scotland's ancient kings. The compendium says it's likely from the 12th century.";
          Dovecote: "Dovecotes were a common feature of Scottish manor and castle estates and served a number of purposes. One was to provide a source of fresh meat and eggs for the lord and his family, but it was also a symbol of status and wealth. The first dovecote on the grounds of Blackwood was probably built from wood and replaced with one made of stone in the 14th century.";
          Crypt: "While the compendium does not mention the crypt explicitly. It is noted, however, that from the time when Blackwood was a monastery, a vault is rumored to exist where an unspecified saint is said to have found his final resting place.";
          Solar: "The solar is a grand chamber that was once the private quarters of the Lord and Lady of the manor. The manor's Solar is filled with the trappings of luxury and refinement, from the rich tapestries that adorn the walls to the antique furniture. The origin of the word solar is not clear. It may derive from the word ~solaris~, which means ~sun~, describing a room with the brightest aspect, but since the solar provided distance from the great hall and thus privacy for the Lord and his family, it could also derive from the word ~solus~, meaning ~alone~.";

In a book about the saints of Scotland and Northumbria, you discover a drawing of Saint Cuthbert, probably the most famous saint of early Britain. In this drawing you can see that he is wearing the amulet. Legend has it that the stone came from Golgotha. At the very moment Jesus Christ died, lightning struck the earth and created what you suspected to be trinitite. It reflects a moment when a bridge was built between the world of the living and the world of the dead.^^The amulet is said to have enabled its bearer to communicate with those who passed on to the other side. It is not recorded how the relic came to Northumbria, but it is said Cuthbert used it to speak to dead saints and martyrs. After Cuthbert's death the amulet vanished from history and was never seen again. Many scholars have therefore assumed that it was a metaphor and not a real object, which you now believe had been brought to the Blackwood Monastery.^^As you are about to leave, you hear a distant voice calling out to you.

I have been given many names since I walk the earth. Feel free to choose one. I prefer Morning Star or Light Bearer.^^Her eyes, devoid of colour and depth, glow with an eldritch light that seems to penetrate you.

You approach the coffin and your heart races as you observe the macabre scene inside. The unholy boy's features are twisted in an expression of eternal torment. Flames dance mercilessly across his form, leaping in a grotesque ballet, consuming what little is left of his earthly vessel. His eyes, empty sockets now, seem to pierce through the veil between worlds, staring into the evil void from which he came.^^You turn slowly and Ysabella stands before you. Her eyes, pools of darkness, seem to hold both the weight of forgotten ages and the fire of a thousand stars. Time bends around her, and with a single heartbeat, the world transforms. The air grows even colder, and the icy breeze cuts with rage through the graveyard, carrying with it a mournful symphony of whispers and sighs.

The pure evil that emanates from her is palpable, a noxious miasma that curls and coils around your senses, a suffocating embrace that fills the air with impending doom.^^It is then, in that chilling moment, that realization dawns like a jagged lightning bolt. The woman before you is not merely a specter of the past, nor a mere haunt of this forsaken ground. No, she is something far more ancient, far more insidious. Lucifer, the Morning Star, the embodiment of all that is forbidden and accursed. Her lips part, and a sound emerges, a voice that seems to reverberate not only in the confines of your mind but also in the very marrow of your bones.^^Lucifer: You will regret this.^She hisses, her words both a venomous caress and a sinister threat that echoes through the forest. A brief interlude that seems to last for aeons until she vanishes before you.^^And then you see him. The ghost of an old man who apparently watched your confrontation with Lucifer and her offspring, bathed in a faint, ethereal glow, emerging from the halo above his head.^^Cuthbert: You have done well, my son. I am Cuthbert of Lindisfarne.^You: I have so many questions.^^Cuthbert: And I'm afraid I don't have many answers, nor can I linger here for long. Everything happened as it had to happen, both then and now.^He extends a hand towards you.^Cuthbert: I'll take the amulet with me. It has served its purpose.^^You: Oh, the amulet. I understand that I had to find it in order to speak to Lord Bain. Without it, I'm sure I would have made a terrible mistake. But why did Lucifer want me to wear it here too?^Cuthbert: The Morning Star is a master of deception. In fact, the amulet was also an important component of her unholy ritual. Only a thin veil separates this world from other planes of existence. And the amulet is a key to look behind it. She would have used it to open the gates of hell and plunge the world into chaos forever.^You shiver as you think about it.^^So you remove the amulet and you hold it in your hand for a moment, where it sparkles as it reflects the light of the winter sun. Just a blink of an eye and then everything is gone. The amulet, Cuthbert, the coffin, even the charred remains of the unholy tome.^^As you make your way home, the day begins to fade towards dusk and a sense of calm settles in. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows on the landscape. When you reach the manor's feral garden, the sun inches close to the horizon and bathes the grounds of Blackwood in a warm glow of gold and amber.
